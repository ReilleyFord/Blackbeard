(like the pirate... Get it?)</br >
version: 0.0.1</br >
Tested on High Sierra and Windows 10

Simple tool that reads a directory and renames all files based on the users input.
Very specific tool i made for myself because i got tired of renaming downloaded TV Shows and movies one by one in the naming structure that i use.

How to use
==========
It's a simple cmd line tool. Just put your files directly into `Input` and then run
`node app.js` from the command line.
